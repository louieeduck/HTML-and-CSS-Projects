	<h1> Bee Movie </h1>
	<p>
According to all known laws of aviation,<br>
there is no way a bee<br>
should be able to fly.<br>
Its wings are too small to get<br>
its fat little body off the ground.<br>
The bee, of course, flies anyway<br>
because bees don't care<br>
what humans think is impossible.<br>

Shrek: For your information, there's a lot more to ogres than people think.<br>
Donkey: Example?<br>
Shrek: Example? Okay, um, ogres are like onions.<br>
Donkey: [Sniffs] They stink?<br>
Shrek: Yes-- No!<br>
Donkey: They make you cry?<br>
Shrek: No!<br>
Donkey: You leave them out in the sun, they get all brown, start sproutin' little white hairs.<br>
Shrek: No! Layers! Onions have layers. Ogres have layers! Onions have layers. You get it? We both have layers. [Sighs]<br>
Donkey: Oh, you both have layers. Oh. [Sniffs] You know, not everybody likes onions. Cakes! Everybody loves cakes! Cakes have layers.<br>
